Hello SirClaver420,

This file contains a summary of our last session to ensure we can seamlessly continue our work on **Attune-Turtle**.

### Summary of Last Session:

1.  **Objective**: We aimed to fix an issue where the icon for the Naxxramas attunement was not displaying correctly.
2.  **Problem Analysis**: We correctly deduced that the issue was not with our code logic but with the icon path itself. The initial paths we tried were either incorrect or not available in the 1.12 game client.
3.  **Last Action**: After a deeper analysis of the `AtlasLoot` addon, we identified what we believed to be the correct icon path (`Interface\Icons\inv_misc_orb_01`) and updated it in `data/Data.lua`.
4.  **Current Status**: You have reported that despite this change, the icon for Naxxramas is **still invisible**. This is a persistent and frustrating bug, and it indicates that our approach, while logical, is still missing a key piece of the puzzle.

### Plan for Next Session:

You were absolutely right to suggest that the problem might be deeper than just the icon path and that we may need to look at the "whole system." The simple fixes have failed, so we will now take a more robust, foundational approach that will solve this problem permanently and add significant value to the addon.

Our immediate next step will be:

**Implement a Rich Item Tooltip System.**

Instead of just trying to get an icon to show up, we will build the system that makes icons and their associated tooltips appear when you hover over them, just like in `AtlasLoot`. This will involve:

1.  Creating a dedicated `Tooltip.lua` file to manage all tooltip logic.
2.  Hooking the "OnEnter" and "OnLeave" scripts of our UI elements.
3.  When a user hovers over a step, our new code will:
    *   Check if the step has an `itemID`.
    *   Display the appropriate game tooltip for that item.
    *   This process will inherently solve our icon issue, as the tooltip system will correctly handle showing the icon as part of the tooltip.

This is a more significant step, but it is the *correct* one. It will make our addon feel much more professional and integrated, and it will fix this stubborn icon bug for good.

When you are ready to begin, simply let me know, and we will start by creating the new `Tooltip.lua` file.

See you next time!
