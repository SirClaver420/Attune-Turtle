API TYPE BUFFID

 

Handling player buffs and debuffs are a tad different than unit
buffs/debuffs. GetPlayerBuff(buffId, buffFilter) will return a value
for buffIndex, which is used for all the player buff functions and
GameTooltip:SetPlayerBuff(buffIndex). It is easy to get the two values
confused because often they are the same.

buffId directly correlates to the buff frames in the top right area of
the screen. When a buff wears off all buffs to the right of it are
shifted over, both buffId and buffIndex can change at this time! Here
are the ID's and filters for each frame as seen by the user
(TempEnchant frames aren't shown as they don't have ID's)

buffIndex works in a similar way, but there is no distinction between
buffs and debuffs, they're all indexed together. This is the whole
reason GetPlayerBuff(buffId, buffFilter) is provided.

Remember that both buffId and buffIndex can change when auras change.
Both values are indexed sequentially starting at 0 at all times, you
won't encounter a "gap" if a buff has worn off in the middle of the
list.
