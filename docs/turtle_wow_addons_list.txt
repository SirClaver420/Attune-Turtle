About Addons[]

Coming from Blizzard Retail/Classic? Read Me!

Turtle WoW 1.17.2 is a mod of the 2006 version of the game that uses the original 1.12 WoW Vanilla client. As such, Classic addons (usually marked for version 1.13/1.15) DO NOT WORK! If you are coming from Classic, forget all of what you know about addons and be prepared to find a completely new set of addons to accomplish what you want.

Addons used by TWoW players are a mix of:a

Old addons developed back in the day, back in 2006 New addons developed more recently in the private server era And modified versions of old and new addons, updated specifically with fixes that accomidate Turtle's changes to the 1.12 game.

The #Full Addons List section intends to always list the correct version that you should use.

WeakAuras

Back in the day, there existed an addon called PowerAuras that simply allowed for easy visual tracking of buffs and debuffs. However, those of you who play on newer versions of WoW may know of PA's succssor: WeakAuras. WA has gone from just buff tracking to serving as a convenient platform for "mini-addons" that many players end up using extensively. WeakAuras DOES NOT EXIST for Turtle WoW! Instead, players on old WoW will make completely separate addons to accomplish the same things that WA does. So if you are looking for a replacement for a specific WA then look for these separate addons instead.

How to Install Addons[]

Easy GUI Addons Manager

Think you will be on Turtle for a while and want a sustainable easy solution to addon management, like Curseforge for Retail/Classic? Annoyed by extracting and renaming addons? Want to update all your addons in one button press? This method is a bit more effort to set up at first but it's worth it in the long run.

Download the GitAddonsManager program, and use your file manager to unzip the manager program. This program does not need to be anywhere specific, just place it somewhere you'll remember. Go to where you unzipped it, find GitAddonsManager.exe and right click to create a shortcut to make it convenient to use this launcher. Launch the manager with the shortcut. Complete the first time setup, it will ask where your addons folder is, so give it the location of your TurtleWoW/Interface/AddOns/ folder.

With setup complete, you are now ready to install addons with this manager. If you had any manually installed copies of git addons then go delete those. Those old manual installations you have made cannot be updated with this GUI Manager.

Any time that you find a new GitHub or Gitlab addon you want to install:

Copy down the clone link for the git addon, for example https://github.com/shagu/ShaguTweaks.git

On the Addons Manager, press the + button on the top left, and paste in the URL. Press OK. The addon will download and install.

All done. Every so often open this app to press the Upgrade button on the top left. This will update all of your addons at once using the power of Git.

Restart your game. If the installation worked correctly then you should see an Addons button on the bottom left of the character select screen. In that list you should see your installed addon listed.

Installing Addons by Hand

This method is simple and works with any addon you find, even ones that don't use git, but the downside is that there's no easy way to update all your addons at once. If that is okay with you then learn this manual installation process:

Visit the github link you find, then click the green <> Code button, and select Download ZIP. Use 7zip to extract the zip into your TurtleWoW/Interface/AddOns/ folder. Rename the addon's folder. This is the tricky part, Read Carefully:In order for WoW to actually load your addon, the folder name that contains the addon and name of the the .toc file within MUST match. For example, if the addon has the file Some-Addon.toc, you must name the folder Some-Addon. When done correctly, your folder and file structure should look like TurtleWoW/Interface/AddOns/ADDONNAME/ADDONNAME.toc.

In most cases of downloading an addon from github, this just means deleting "-master" or "-main" from the folder name.

Beware! Some addons like Aux come with a mismatched folder name. If an addon isn't loading, you really do need to check that .toc file.

Beware! Some addons like DPSMate will bury themselves a folder too deep. If your file/folder structure looks like TurtleWoW/Interface/AddOns/REPONAME-MASTER/ADDONNAME/ADDONNAME.toc, this addon will not work! In this case, you need to pull out the addons from that bad containing folder. If this step still gives you trouble then consider giving the automated AddonsFixer a try.

Restart your game and if the installation worked correctly then you should see an Addons button on the bottom left of the character select screen. In that list you should see your installed addon listed.

Command-line Addons Manager

If you prefer a command-line interface, you may use snapjaw, a git-based addons manager. For detailed information, please refer to the readme file on GitHub.

How to Update Addons[]

[Updated 2025 Jan]: Best Recommended Method is to use the TurtleWoW Launcher to verify and update accordingly.

NOTE: Don't worry about your addon settings! Your game and addon settings are saved separately, in the TurtleWoW/WTF folder, and as long as you don't mess with that folder, your settings will persist across addon updates, uninstalls, and reinstalls.

How to Troubleshoot Addons[]

If Installed Addon Isn't Showing up restart your game, log back in, and on the character select screen, you should see an addons button, click that.

Do you see your addon on this list?

If not, the installation failed and you should review #How to Install Addons. If the addon does show on this list and is activated, the addon is indeed installed correctly and should be working once you load a character. If you aren't sure how the addon is supposed to be used and tinkered with, refer to the addon's readme on github, and if you are still stumped, ask on our discord addons channel for help.

To install these addons, you must use the manual method, and you will never receive updates for these.

If one of these old addons bugs out and breaks due to Turtle WoW's changes, someone can fix it for Turtle and add the fixed Turtle version to the above addons list. Be sure to check to see if someone's done this already.

Do you have a secret dream of becoming a famous addon developer superstar and get all the nerdy wow girls like Shagu? Take your first steps to achieve the dream by reading a short tutorial from the man himself. Also consider reading the FirstSteps guide.

Basic loop to write an Addon[]

Write Lua, XML, .toc as text file, and place them in a folder in game's Interface/AddOns. You could use an IDE like Visual Studio or a text editor like Notepad++ to do this. Run the game to see if the addon is working. If there is bug, the easiest way is to use message("string") or DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage("string") trying to output some info from your program to find the bug. If you need advanced debug feature like Step by Step Execution or Call Stack Inspector, you could try the UnitXP_SP3 full package, it includes an advanced Lua debugger for the game.
