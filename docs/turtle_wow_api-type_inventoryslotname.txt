API TYPE INVENTORYSLOTNAME

 

Rather than use hard-coded ID's for inventory slots, each slot is
mapped to a numeric ID at runtime using the API GetInventorySlotInfo
function. This allows for future expansion and addition of new slots,
as well as re-ordering of slots in the underlying code. Known slot
ID's are as follows (and appear to be case insensitive):
