API TYPE BAGID

 

While dealing with container and inventory items, many developers use
a bag/slot couple and set bag to -1 for the case of an inventory item.
But a problem occurs when the bank is opened (after BANKFRAME_OPENED
event being fired) because the 24 slots of the bank count as a
container with -1 as bagID. In the same idea, items in the bank bags
can be accessed via container item functions (like
GetContainerItemLink(bagID, slotID), PickupContainerItem(bagID,
slotID)) with 5 as bagID for the first bank bag, 6 for the second ...
until 10 for the sixth.

To sum up, the possibilities for bagID are :

 0 for the backpack
 1 to 4 for the bags on the character (numbered right to left)
 -2 for the keyring

WHILE THE BANK IS OPENED :

 -1 for the bank content
 5 to 10 for bank bags (numbered left to right)
