### A Note from the Author

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a regular player who decided to try making their first WoW addon. Before this, I had zero experience with programmingâ€”I literally started from "what is Lua?" and "how do WoW addons even work?"

I loved the original Attune addon during Season of Discovery and was surprised I couldn't find anything similar for Turtle WoW. So, I thought... "I wonder if I could make one myself?" Spoiler alert: it's way harder than I expected, but also way more fun!

I'm learning everything as I go with the help of AI tools like GitHub Copilot, working on this in my spare time after work. This is a passion project for the love of the game and the Turtle WoW community.

**Please Note:** I am not affiliated with the Turtle WoW team, Blizzard, or any official entities whatsoever.

This also means that I'm definitely a noob developer learning as I go. If you find bugs or have suggestions, please be patient! Your feedback, bug reports, and contributions are essential to making this addon great. ðŸ˜…
