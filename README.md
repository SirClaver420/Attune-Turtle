### A Note from the Author

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a regular player who decided to try making their first WoW addon. Before this, I had zero experience with programmingâ€”I literally started from "what is Lua?" and "how do WoW addons even work?"

I loved the original Attune addon during Season of Discovery and was surprised I couldn't find anything similar for Turtle WoW. So, I thought... "I wonder if I could make one myself?" Spoiler alert: it's way harder than I expected, but also way more fun!

I'm learning everything as I go with the help of AI tools like GitHub Copilot, working on this in my spare time after work. This is a passion project for the love of the game and the Turtle WoW community.

**Please Note:** I am not affiliated with the Turtle WoW team, Blizzard, or any official entities whatsoever.

This also means that I'm definitely a noob developer learning as I go. If you find bugs or have suggestions, please be patient! Your feedback, bug reports, and contributions are essential to making this addon great. ðŸ˜…

## Roadmap

This addon is under active development. The goal is to first build a robust, feature-rich foundation before populating all the attunement data.

### Phase 1: Static UI Foundation (v1.0.1) - âœ… Complete

-   [x] Build a stable, non-resizable UI window.
-   [x] Create the sidebar, content area, and scroll frames.
-   [x] Implement a landing page and basic attunement views.
-   [x] Add a minimap icon and slash commands.
-   [x] Populate with placeholder data for major attunements.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Next Up)

The primary focus is on building the core systems that will power the addon.

-   **Dynamic Window:**
    -   ðŸ”³ Make the main window resizable and dynamic.
-   **Per-Character Progress:**
    -   ðŸ”³ Modify the database (`SavedVariables`) to store attunement progress on a per-character basis.
-   **Automatic Faction Detection:**
    -   ðŸ”³ Implement logic to automatically detect the player's faction (Horde/Alliance) to display the correct quest lines.
-   **Automation Engine:**
    -   ðŸ”³ Create a system to automatically check for quest completions.
    -   ðŸ”³ Add checks for required items in the player's inventory.
    -   ðŸ”³ Visually mark steps as "complete" in the UI based on player progress.
-   **Advanced UI Features:**
    -   ðŸ”³ Implement rich tooltips that show item/quest details on hover.
    -   ðŸ”³ Create a dedicated settings panel for user customization.

### Phase 3: Content & Data Population

Once the foundation is complete, the focus will shift to adding all the specific attunement data.

-   **Data Implementation:**
    -   ðŸ”³ Implement step-by-step data for all keys (Mallet of Zul'Farrak, UBRS Key, etc.).
    -   ðŸ”³ Implement step-by-step data for all raid attunements (MC, BWL, Naxxramas).
    -   ðŸ”³ Add data for custom raids like **Emerald Sanctum**.
    -   ðŸ”³ Ensure data for both Horde and Alliance quest chains is complete.
