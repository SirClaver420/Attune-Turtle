# Attune Turtle

An attunement tracking addon for [Turtle WoW](https://turtle-wow.org), helping players track their progress through dungeon keys and raid attunement chains.

## About the Project

Hey there! üëã I'm just a regular player who decided to try making their first WoW addon. I have zero experience with addon development - I literally started from "what is Lua?" and "how do WoW addons even work?" 

I loved the original Attune addon during Season of Discovery and when I couldn't find anything similar for Turtle WoW, I thought... "I wonder if I could make one myself?" Spoiler alert: it's way harder than I expected, but also way more fun!

I'm learning everything as I go - from basic Lua scripting to WoW's API to how GitHub works. Every single feature that works in this addon represents me googling "how to..." and probably breaking my code several times before figuring it out. 

I'm working on this in my spare time after work, just for the love of the game and the Turtle WoW community. I'm not affiliated with anyone official - just a player who got curious and decided to dive into the deep end of addon development!

**What this means for you:** I'm doing my best, but I'm definitely learning as I go. If you find bugs or have suggestions, please be patient with this noob developer! I'm committed to making this work, even if it takes me a while to figure things out. üòÖ

## Target Features (What I'm Building Toward)

I'm recreating [the official Attune addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/attune) by CixiDelmont, optimized for Turtle WoW.

**Vision for Attune-Turtle:**
- Track dungeon key requirements and steps
- Track additional/optional requirements (like the Zul'Farrak mallet quest chain)
- View raid attunement chains and progress  
- Step-by-step quest and item guidance with clickable links
- Minimap icon for easy access
- Persistent progress tracking
- Automatic quest completion detection
- Character-specific progress
- Export/Import functionality

## Current Features (v1.0.0)

## My Vision: Zul'Farrak Example

Here's exactly what I want the addon to do, using Zul'Farrak as an example:

1. **Click Zul'Farrak** in the left panel ‚Üí Show detailed information
2. **Show dungeon details**: Location, level requirement, overview
3. **Explain the goal**: Acquire the Mallet of Zul'Farrak to summon Gahz'rilla
4. **List benefits**: Gahz'rilla loot, quest rewards (like the Carrot on a Stick), note that only one group member needs the mallet
5. **Step 1**: Obtain "Sacred Mallet" from Qiaga the Keeper at the Altar of Zul (Hinterlands) - with coordinates
6. **Warning**: She's elite and difficult to solo - recommend grouping
7. **Step 2**: Use the Sacred Mallet at the altar to create the "Mallet of Zul'Farrak"
8. **Completion**: Use the mallet in Zul'Farrak to summon the final boss
9. **Progress tracking**: Either automatic detection or manual checkboxes
10. **Visual feedback**: Show completion status in the left panel

All with clickable items, quests, and links to the Turtle WoW database!
