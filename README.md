### A Note from the Author

Hey there! üëã

I'm just a regular player who decided to try making their first WoW addon. Before this, I had zero experience with programming‚ÄîI literally started from "what is Lua?" and "how do WoW addons even work?"

I loved the original Attune addon during Season of Discovery and was surprised I couldn't find anything similar for Turtle WoW. So, I thought... "I wonder if I could make one myself?" Spoiler alert: it's way harder than I expected, but also way more fun!

I'm learning everything as I go with the help of AI tools like GitHub Copilot, working on this in my spare time after work. This is a passion project for the love of the game and the Turtle WoW community.

**Please Note:** I am not affiliated with the Turtle WoW team, Blizzard, or any official entities whatsoever.

This also means that I'm definitely a noob developer learning as I go. If you find bugs or have suggestions, please be patient! Your feedback, bug reports, and contributions are essential to making this addon great. üòÖ

## Known Issues

-   **Placeholder Data:** Many attunement steps currently contain placeholder text. The focus is on building the addon's core features first before populating all the detailed quest data.
-   **No Automatic Tracking:** The addon does not yet automatically track your quest progress. This is a primary goal for a future version.

## Roadmap

This addon is under active development. The goal is to first build a robust, feature-rich foundation before populating all the attunement data.

### Phase 1: UI Foundation (v1.0.2) - ‚úÖ Complete

-   ‚úÖ Build a stable UI window.
-   ‚úÖ Make the main window resizable and dynamic.
-   ‚úÖ Create the sidebar, content area, and scroll frames.
-   ‚úÖ Implement a landing page and basic attunement views.
-   ‚úÖ Add a minimap icon and slash commands.
-   ‚úÖ Populate with placeholder data for major attunements.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Current Phase)

The primary focus is on building the core systems that will power the addon.

-   **Advanced UI Features:**
    -   ‚òëÔ∏è **In Progress:** Implement rich tooltips that show item/quest details on hover. This will also fix all item icon display issues.
    -   üî≥ Create a dedicated options panel for user customization.
-   **Per-Character Progress:**
    -   üî≥ Modify the database (`SavedVariables`) to store attunement progress on a per-character basis.
-   **Automation Engine:**
    -   üî≥ Create a system to automatically check for quest completions.
    -   üî≥ Add checks for required items in the player's inventory.
    -   üî≥ Visually mark steps as "complete" in the UI based on player progress.
-   **Code Quality & Structure:**
    -   ‚úÖ Restructured addon into `core` and `data` folders for professional-level maintainability.

### Phase 3: Content & Data Population

Once the foundation is complete, the focus will shift to adding all the specific attunement data.

-   **Data Implementation:**
    -   üî≥ Implement step-by-step data for all keys (Mallet of Zul'Farrak, UBRS Key, etc.).
    -   üî≥ Implement step-by-step data for all raid attunements (MC, BWL, Naxxramas).
    -   üî≥ Add data for custom raids like **Emerald Sanctum**.
    -   üî≥ Ensure data for both Horde and Alliance quest chains is complete.

## Version History

-   **v1.0.3 (2025-09-07)**
    -   **Major Code Refactor:** Restructured the entire addon to follow professional standards, separating logic files (`core/`) from data files (`data/`). This improves maintainability and scalability, mirroring the structure of robust addons like `AtlasLoot`.
    -   **Foundation for Tooltips:** Created the core `Tooltip.lua` module, laying the groundwork for a new system to display rich, interactive item tooltips on hover, which will resolve icon display bugs permanently.
    -   **Code Cleanup:** Standardized internal functions and text to use "Options" for consistency, removing confusing "Settings" references.
-   **v1.0.2 (2025-09-06)**
    -   Implemented a fully resizable and draggable main window.
    -   Window size and position are now saved between sessions.
    -   Fixed numerous bugs related to UI scripts and frame handling.
-   **v1.0.1 (2025-09-06)**
    -   Finalized and polished the static UI layout.
    -   Cleaned up code and added comments across all files.
    -   Improved the addon loading message in chat.
    -   Updated the project roadmap for the next phase of development.
-   **v1.0.0 (2025-09-06)**
    -   Initial release.
    -   Established core UI, data structure, and basic functionality.
